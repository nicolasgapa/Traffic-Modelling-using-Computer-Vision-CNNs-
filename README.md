This project is divided in three parts. 

1. Classification network (classification_network.py).
   
   In order for this file to work, you must add training and validation images
   to the respective folders. Those were not added to the Github repository due
   to size. However, training images can be downloaded from the COCO dataset or  
   any other open-source image datatset.
